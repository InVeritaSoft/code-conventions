</h1>

The place for company's technology/language specific code conventions

These conventions are guidelines and standards that developers should follow when writing code

They aim to reduce software defects, encourage consistency in the code, and improve readability and maintainability

### Coding conventions serve the following purposes:
- Promote code consistency across projects and teams
- Improve the readability of the source code, which makes it easier to maintain software
- Create a consistent look to the code, so that readers can focus on content, not layout
- Enable readers to understand the code more quickly by making assumptions based on previous - experience
- Facilitate copying, changing, and maintaining the code
- Demonstrate best practices
